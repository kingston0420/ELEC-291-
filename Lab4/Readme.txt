This project is a 555 Timer/Capacitance Meter
From clock sources to test signals, timers are often needed when designing and testing 
electronic circuits. One of such circuits is the iconic ‘555 timer’ introduced by Signetics in 1971 
and designed by Hans R. Camenzind. In this project, I design, build, 
and test a 555 timer equivalent circuit from its basic building blocks. Then use the 555 
timer to build a capacitance meter. 
This is done by programming the EFM8LB1 microcontroller using the C 
programming language.
