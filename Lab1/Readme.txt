This laboratory module shows how to build a simple microcontroller system using the 
Atmel AT89LP51RC2 microcontroller. The AT89LP51RC2 is a modern derivative of the 
Industry Standard 8051 microcontroller developed by Intel in the early 1980â€™s. As part of this 
module, students will compile, download, and run programs into the microcontroller system. 
Finally in this laboratory module, students will be attaching an LCD to the microcontroller 
system and display their names and student number on it.
